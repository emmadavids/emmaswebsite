      <h2>Cycling</h2>In lieu of anything interesting I can think of to fill my webpages with (using ipsom lorem is too <i>pedestrian</i>, here is a couple of my favourite cycling routes.<br>
     
     <h3>Chew Valley Lake</h3><div class="cheddarphots">

     About 23 miles from Bristol, this one is mostly along cycle paths and quiet roads. There are some challenging climbs, but the route is short enough for these to be doable (save for one where I had to get off and push my bike up). I have linked to my Strava activity <a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/3475994607">here</a> so you can see the route I took and maybe download the GPX file and put it on your activity tracker.
     <br><br>
     <h3>Cheddar Gorge</h3><div class="bike-wrapperone">

   <br><p>Okay so this is not for the faint hearted, over 55 miles round trip and some very tough climbs. There is a shorter way to get there (you can google this), but this way goes a quiet route down to Clevedon and then down the traffic-free strawberry line from there to Cheddar. The scenery is fantastic for most of the way, much more so than my photos suggest.</p>

   I would recommend stopping at the <a href="https://lionrocktearooms.co.uk/">Lion Rock Tearoom</a> to refuel, plenty of treats including vegan options such as biscoff lattes, chilli and chips and cream teas. After that you can head back through the gorge (probably the longest climb, you can pretend you're stopping to admire the stunning scenery rather than because your thighs are burning and you can't breathe) and then through the Mendip Hills, down to Barrow Gurney and then along the "festival way" back into Bristol. <a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/3449740225">Again, here's a link to my strava activity for the GPX.</a><br><br></p>
